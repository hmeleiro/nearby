# Nearby

[Nearby](http://shiny.hmeleiro.com/nearby/) is an application that allows the user to explore the [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/12.13996/-86.22937) database. The user chooses a distance range with respect to their own geolocation, and the [OSM features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features) they want to search for, and these are displayed on the map.
